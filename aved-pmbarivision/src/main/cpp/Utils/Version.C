 * work that originated at the 2002 Workshop  Neuromorphic Engineering 
 * in Telluride, CO, USA. 
 * 
 * This code requires the The iLab Neuromorphic Vision C++ Toolkit developed
 * by the University of Southern California (USC) and the iLab at USC. 
 * See http://iLab.usc.edu for information about this project. 
 *  
 * This work would not be possible without the generous support of the
