<h3>About AVEDac<br>
</h3>
In order to study the distribution and abundance of oceanic animals,
MBARI uses high-resolution video equipment on remotely operated
vehicles. Quantitative video transects (QVTs) supplant traditional net
tows to assess the quantity and diversity of organisms in the water
column. QVTs are run from 50 m to 4000 m and provide high-resolution
data at the scale of the individual animals as well as their natural
aggregation patterns. However, the current, manual method of analyzing
QVTs is labor intensive and tedious.
<p>For more information about the AVEDac project, see <a
 href="http://www.mbari.org/aved">http://www.mbari.org/aved</a>
</p>
<p> AVEDac was developing to assist this process by
automated the
detecting marine organisms visible in the videos. Video frames are
processed with a neuromorphic selective attention algorithm. The
candidate objects of interest are tracked across video frames using
linear Kalman filters or Nearest Neighbor algorithms. If objects can be
tracked successfully over
several frames, they are labeled as potentially interesting and marked
in the video frames and saved to a XML-formatted file. The plan is that
the system will enhance the
productivity of human video annotators and/or cue a subsequent object
classification module by marking candidate objects. The software for
this automated detection and tracking is called&nbsp;<span
 style="font-style: italic;">mbarivision</span> and can
be found, along with the code for this graphical interface) at&nbsp;<a
 href="http://avedac.google.code./"> http://avedac.google.code</a></p>
Once
events are detected in mbarivision, they are written to a
AVEDac events XML file. This graphical interface is designed for
editing the mbarivision&nbsp; generated&nbsp; events.
Currently, the
only editing
cability is to only delete or combine events. However, more complex
functions may be added in the future such ass adding new events, as
well as the ability to run mbarivision from this graphical interface
(execution is now only through command-line).
<p>For this tool to be useful, you need the event XML file
generated by the AVEDac event detection software <span
 style="font-style: italic;">mbarivision</span> <span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> and </span> the original
video processed used by <span style="font-style: italic;">mbarivision</span>
to generate the XML file as specified in the XML SourceMetadata
element. </p>
<p>Please note that this tool is not an XML
editor and does not
display the raw XML data. Open the XML file in your favorite XML editor
to see all of the XML data. The main purpose of this tool is for
editing events and running the classifier on events found by <span
 style="font-style: italic;">mbarivision</span>.<br>
