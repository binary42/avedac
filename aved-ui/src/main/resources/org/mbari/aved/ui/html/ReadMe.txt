MyJavaHelp HelpSet
==================

The "MyJavaHelp" example is a HelpSet that you build from scratch.
This is the best way to learn JavaHelp.

Although all of the HelpSet files are included in this ZIP archive,
we recommend that you create the HelpSet data and navigation files
yourself. This will help to optimize the JavaHelp learning experience.
Just use the HTML files in this ZIP archive (unless you're also
learning HTML at the same time!).
