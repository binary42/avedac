3.01    * BSD License.

3.0     * Made various changes to keep the functions in sync with the functions
          distributed with MATLAB.
        * Added "pnm" prefix to most files to avoid name collision with the
          functions distributed with MATLAB.
        * Fixed syntax errors in "pbmwrite.m", "pgmwrite.m", "ppmwrite.m",
          "raswrite.m", "sgiwrite.m", "xbmwrite.m".
        * Added "pnmsetup" for much simpler installation.

2.0.2   * Fixed typos in file "install.txt".
        * Using empty string rather than empty matrix as initial value of
          "info.FormatSignature" structure field.
        * Renamed structure field "info.MaxColorComponentValue" to
          "info.MaxValue".
        * Using upper-case letters only in "info.Format" string values (e.g.,
          "PBM" rather than "pbm").
        * Renamed "info.FormatVersion" strings so they now use the files magic
          string (e.g., "P2") rather than a descriptive string.
        * Fixed bug in "impnminfo.m" which computed "info.BitDepth" incorrectly
          for truecolor images.
        * Added 'ScalePixelValues' option to "readpnm.m" so that the function
          can return the raw unscaled pixel values (user request).
        * Grayscale and truecolor images which really are just black and white
          no longer return a logical array.
        * Changed every occurance of "Matlab" to become "MATLAB".
        * In "readras.m", added image composition for truecolor images with
          alpha channel when the alpha channel is not requested (this is for
          compatibility with MATLAB, but I don't know what it's really for).
        * Changed PNM encoding string 'raw' to 'rawbits' and 'plain' to
          'ASCII'.
        * In "writepnm.m", renamed subfunction "write_raw_data" to
          "write_rawbits_data" and "write_plain_data" to "write_ascii_data".
        * A few other minor changes.

2.0.1   * Fixed problem with duplicate PNMGETI.

2.0.0   * New version numbering system like what is common with free
          software.
        * Added support for uint8, uint16, and 3D arrays.
        * Added support for multi-byte PPM/PGM images.
        * Removed the "clever" way of finding magic numbers in PPM/PGM/PBM
          files.  Now the magic number must appear at the beginning of the
          file.
        * Made the reading/writing functions more like the ones in the
          matlab/iofun directory.  Now XXXREAD/XXXWRITE are just wrappers to
          READXXX/WRITEXXX.
        * Much faster writing of ascii (plain) PPM/PGM/PBM images.
        * Added support for RAS (Sun raster images).
        * Added support for SGI/RGBA/RGB/BW (Silicon Graphics images).
        * Lots of trimming and tweaking in the files.
        * WRITEPNM can automatically determine if data is truecolor,
          grayscale or bitmap.
        * Removed IM2IND etc. tools.  Not sure if they belong here.

1.004   * Added XBMREAD and XBMWRITE.

1.003   * Renamed IM2IND2 to IM2INDD (direct conversion).
        * Renamed IM2IND to IM2INDS (very slow but memory efficient
          conversion).
        * Added new and much faster IM2IND which is based on sorting.
        * Added IM2INDR (conversion by removing pixels until none left).
          I'm not sure if is better than the new IM2IND in any way.
        * Fixed some minor errors in documentation.
        * Added PNMGETI which is now used for reading image data from
          ascii images. It ignores bot comments and garbage in ascii
          image files. It replaces the old PNMGETI and PNMGETC.
        * Made PBMREAD robust agains trailing garbage when reading
          binary files. I must have missed this in version 1.001.
        * Fixed problem with files remaining open after error-exits.
        * Changed read/write of binary pgm-files from uint8 to ubit1.
        * Added PNMMAGIC that scans PNM files for magic numbers. The
          introduction of this function has now made the image reading
          functions able to read the example images right out the
          formatted UNIX manual pages pbm(5), pgm(5) and ppm(5)!
        * Suffix is now automatically added also when there is a "dot"
          in the directory name.
        * Toolbox now requires Matlab 5, but still uses the old-style
          way of representing images (no uint8/3D array support yet.)

1.002   * Added test program PNMTEST.
        * Fixed bug in IM2IND regarding conversion of intensity images.
        * Made IM2IND slightly faster.
        * Added IM2IND2, a faster but much simpler version of IM2IND.
        * Ensured compatibility with both Matlab 4.2 and 5.1.

1.001   * Fixed a few errors in the documentation.
        * Made programs more robust agains missing data at end of file.
        * Made programs robust agains trailing garbage in file.
        * Fixed compatibility bug. Should work with Matlab 5 now.

1.000   * First release.
