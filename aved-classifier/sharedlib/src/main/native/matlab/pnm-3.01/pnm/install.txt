Installing the toolbox
======================
You can choose between registering the image formats or not
registering.  I recommend registering the image formats, but
before you decide, understand the difference.

If you choose to register the image formats, you extend IMREAD,
IMWRITE, and IMFINFO so they support the new image formats.  The
new formats are supported "transparently" and you don't use any
special functions to use the new formats.

If you choose not to register, you must use the old-style function
names like PPMREAD, XBMWRITE, etc. which require separate
functions for each image format.

Installing the PNM Toolbox by registering the image formats
-----------------------------------------------------------
Run PNMSETUP with the appropriate option.  Use MATLAB's "addpath"
function to add the "pnm" root directory to MATLAB's search path.
Then type "help pnmsetup" to see how "pnmsetup" is used.

When the formats are registered, IMREAD and IMWRITE will be able
to read and write the new image formats, but they will not contain
any help about the syntax for each of the new formats.  To see
this help, you must read the help in the reading and writing
functions for each formats, for instance, "help pnmreadppn" and
"help pnmwritexbm".

Installing the PNM Toolbox without registering the image formats
----------------------------------------------------------------
Run PNMSETUP.  Use MATLAB's "addpath" function to add the "pnm"
root directory to MATLAB's search path.  Then run "pnmsetup".
Type "help pnm" to see a list of the functions in the toolbox.
