These instructions are only if you are building the AVED classifier
Matlab shared library outside of a Maven build. This is not
recommended, unless you planning on developing your own interface
to the code. To build using the Maven build, see the README
file in the parent directory to this submodule, e.g. if you
installed this into your home directory, 
see /home/dcline/aved/aved-classifier/README.

At MBARI, we use this classifier code both on Linux and Mac OS X.

When running this on Linux, we run this as the user aved with
a single-user Matlab license.

To build the shared library as user aved, execute the following 
in this directory:

su aved -c './createlib'

For more details, see the createlib script. You can modify
this for your installation.
